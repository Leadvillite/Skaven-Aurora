      <p>The Skaven are a race of ratmen. They are may be slightly cowardly, but thier dexterity and wisdom are unlike anything else the world has seen. From silent assasins that strike at unseen angles to engineers that hobble together contraptions beyond comprehension, Skaven are a wonder to behold. </p>
      <p class="indent">The Skaven live under ground in large cities. Many of the note worthy ones typically fall into a few catagories. Sorccerors that bend unknown powers for the benifit of themselves and the ruin of others, Artificers who tinker and create contraptions of varying degrees of destructive power, and Assassins that are masters of stealth, and infiltration.</p>
      <p class="indent">Skaven society is a brutal one. Everyone out for themselves and only the strongest and most cunning rise to the top. Most of these cities are devided into speciallizations, sorccerors will cast out gifted skaven artificers and assassins to protect their hold on power within the city. The others do the same with cities under their control.</p>

    <description>
      <p class="flavor">In their fortresses within Limbo, the githzerai hone their minds to a razor’s edge.</p>
      <p>The githzerai were born as a race at the end of the gith's bloody, genocidal uprising against the mind flayers. A gith named Zerthimon, who had gained a significant following during the conflict, challenged Gith's plans and her leadership. Gith was evil, the newcomer proclaimed, and she would lead the people into darkness and tyranny not unlike the one imposed by the illithids.</p>
      <p class="indent">Thus, no sooner had the gith defeated their sworn enemies than they were plunged into a bitter civil war. In the ensuing conflict, Zerthimon was killed and his followers, naming themselves githzerai, relocated their civilization to the plane of Limbo.</p>
      <p class="indent">Today, under the leadership of the Great Githzerai, Zaerith Menyar-Ag-Gith, the githzerai continue to stand fast against the githyanki, as well as taking their revenge on the mind flayers. Through forays into the Material Plane and other realms, they provide stiff opposition to their enemies' plans for world domination.</p>

      <h4>GITHZERAI TRAITS</h4>
      <p>Githzerai have the following traits in common, in addition to the traits they share with other gith.</p>
      <p class="indent"><b><i>Ability Score Increase. </i></b>Your Wisdom score increases by 2.</p>
      <p class="indent"><b><i>Alignment. </i></b>Githzerai tend toward lawful neutral. Their rigorous training in psychic abilities requires an implacable mental discipline.</p>
      <p class="indent"><b><i>Mental Discipline. </i></b>You have advantage on saving throws against the charmed and frightened conditions. Under the tutelage of monastic masters, githzerai learn to govern their own minds.</p>
      <p class="indent"><b><i>Githzerai Psionics. </i></b>You know the mage hand cantrip, and the hand is invisible when you cast the cantrip with this trait.</p>

When you reach 5th level, you can cast the detect thoughts spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.</p>
      <p class="indent">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells. When you cast them with this trait, they don't require components.</p>
